DroughtMonitor
==============

An experiment in using an Arduino and sensors to create personal drought monitors to crowdsource large scale weather information. See the Fritzing diagram and the code comments for more information.

Parts
-----

The Fritzing file will show the wiring diagram, based on the Arduino Prototype board we're using. Future updates will include a breadboarded version for more clarity.

* Arduino Uno
* A Sparkfun WiFly Shield
* An Arduino Prototype Shield
* A DHT22 temperature sensor
* Two galvanized carriage bolts (depicted as antennae on the Fritzing diagram)
* An account at Xively (formerly Cosm and Pachube)
* A wireless network to connect to.
